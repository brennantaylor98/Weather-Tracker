# Weather Tracker

## Introduction
Hello, my name is Brennan. I've created this simple weather tracker application. It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, and Bootstrap. This project honed my abilty to stylize, call proper functions, follow correct order syntax, and much more. This project was created for the U.C. Davis coding bootcamp class.

## Description
This project allows you browse the weather in cities of your choosing. Once your city is inputed to the search bar your city will be displayed to the right with the tempature, humidity, and wind speed. Along with the current weather information you will also see a 5 day forecast below so you will be further prepped for any future vactions or trips you may be taking. Cities that you've searched are saved under the search bar for you to go back too and there is also a clear button to clear out your past searches so they arent bogging up the screen.

## Installation
This Weather Tracker is very easy to install. Navigate to the page, and input your city and all corrasponding information will be available. Alternatively from my github profile you may also use the link function found at the top right too be directed straight to the site itself.

## Thanks
